# dotfiles-mac
dotfiles for my Mac, hopefully find a way to take a note on how to set it ground up as well e

PUT SHORTCUTS on .skhdrc instead of any other custom places provided by raycast or aerospace

#ToDo
- dotfiles installation manual / sh script
- sh script for sketchy bar and figure out what kind of design do I want to use for it
- fix overlapping logo on sketchybar
- turn the sketchybar's right to be clickable, preferably if a menu could pop out
